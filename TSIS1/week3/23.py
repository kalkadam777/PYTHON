where Ip is the  angular momentum of the frame without weights,
is the mass of each additional weight, l1is their  distance from 
the axis of rotation. We will ignore rotational inertia of the stacked bullet,
because its mass is small com-pared to the mass of the frame and additional weights (3.30 g).
According to the conservation of angular momentum law:
